üß† Graph8 Full-Stack Migration Challenge: PingCRM ‚Üí React + FastAPI

Overview
You‚Äôll be rebuilding the PingCRM (Rails) open-source CRM app using a modern stack (they are not affiliated in any way with graph8, we just used a smaller opensource project on github for the challenge):

Frontend: React + TypeScript
Backend: FastAPI (Python)
Database: PostgreSQL (required)
Deployment: Use free services (e.g., Vercel + Render + Supabase)

This is a real-world migration test. You‚Äôll reference an existing Rails app but rebuild it fully in a new stack. We‚Äôre looking for clean structure, sensible decisions, and working features.

‚úÖ Core Functionality to Rebuild
You should include:
Contact Management
List, create, edit, delete contacts
Each contact should have a name, phone, city, and associated company
Company Management
List and create/edit/delete companies
Associate contacts with companies
Search & Filter
Dashboard-style list with basic filtering or searching (by contact name or company)

üß∞ Tech Stack Requirements
Frontend:
React (with TypeScript)
React Router
Axios or Fetch
Tailwind CSS or any light styling
Backend:
FastAPI
PostgreSQL (required ‚Äî use Supabase, Render, or Neon for free hosting)
SQLAlchemy + Pydantic
CORS enabled
Deployment:
Frontend: Deploy on Vercel (free)
Backend: Deploy on Render or Deta (free)
Database: Use Supabase or Neon (free Postgres hosting)

üéØ General Guidelines
No need to implement user auth (assume the user is logged in)
Feel free to use AI tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenHand, Devin AI or ChatGPT ‚Äî we want to see how you use them smartly
You will be evaluated on:
Structure and clarity of your code
API and frontend functionality
Sensible tech choices
Thoughtful error handling
Deployment completeness (bonus but strongly encouraged)
Migration Documentation

üì¶ Deliverables
Please submit a GitHub repo with this structure:
/frontend   (React + TypeScript)
/backend    (FastAPI)
/README.md  (includes instructions and links)
Your README.md should include:
How to run the project locally (both frontend and backend)
What database you used and how to connect
Deployment URLs:
Live frontend on Vercel
Live backend on Render or Deta
Supabase/Neon link not required, but backend should be able to connect
Notes on:
What‚Äôs complete or partially done
Time spent
What AI tools (if any) you used

‚è± Time Limit
Spend no more than 4‚Äì5 hours total on this. Prioritize:
Functional features over polish
Clear API and frontend structure
Demonstrating your workflow
